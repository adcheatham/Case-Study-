# Case-Study-
 How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?
After successfully completing the Google Data Analytics Certification course, I am now ready to tackle a case study provided by Google.

I will share my insights and provide informed recommendations on the marketing strategies that will contribute to the company’s remarkable success.

To ensure a structured and thorough analysis, I will follow Google’s data analysis process, consisting of six key steps: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.
### Scenario and Role
Cyclistic is a fictional bike-sharing company in Chicago. They feature more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations across the city.

Cyclistic offers flexible pricing plans, including single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Casual riders, who purchase single-ride or full-day passes, make up one segment, while Cyclistic members are those who have purchased annual memberships. Financial analysis indicates that annual members are more profitable than casual riders, leading Cyclistic to prioritize converting casual riders into members for future growth.

The director of the marketing team and manager, Lily Moreno, believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth.

As a part of Moreno’s team and as a junior data analyst, I was tasked with digging into the company’s historical bike trips to identify trends to help the company design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.
